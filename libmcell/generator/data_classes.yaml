              This molecule diffuses in space with diffusion constant D. D can
              be zero, in which case the molecule doesnâ€™t move.
              The units of D are cm 2 /s.

              Release molecules in the specified shape. Valid shapes are 'cubic',
              spherical', 'spherical_shell', and 'list'; or the name of the 
              name of region(s) on which to release.

              The named molecule is the one that will be released. Not used for 
              the 'list' shape. You must specify an orientation if the molecule 
                is a surface molecule.

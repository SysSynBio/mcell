# An example model for running NFsim to get you started.
#
# Comments in BNGL are always preceded with a pound (#) character, so that any text that
# follows a pound character is ignored.  The model file below is commented to help you
# understand the main parts of a BNGL file.  Note that some commands at the end of the
# model file that allow you to run the model with different simulators are commented out.
# To use these other options, simply remove the pound character before the command.





# The first part of a BNGL file is the parameters block, where you can define the rates
# of equations or the starting numbers of any of the molecular species.
begin parameters
   kon 10
   koff 5
   kcat 0.7
   dephos 0.5
end parameters



# Next, we define the set of molecule types in the system.  This is a declaration only, so
# we don't specify how many of each molecules there are, and we have to provide a list
# of all possible state values for each component of each molecule with a tilda (~)
# character.
begin molecule types
  X(y,p~0~1)
  Y(x)
end molecule types



# This is a very simple system indeed.  The only rules that are defined
# tell us that X can bind Y if X is dephosphorylated.  Then the XY complex
# can either disassociate, or a phosphorylation reaction can occur.  Finally, X
# will dephosphorylate regardless of whether or not it is bound to Y, although
# for these rules, it will always be unbound to Y if it is phosphorylated.
# Here are the rule definitions:
begin reaction rules

   X(y,p~0) + Y(x) -> X(y!1,p~0).Y(x!1)   kon
   X(y!1,p~0).Y(x!1) -> X(y,p~0) + Y(x)   koff
   X(y!1,p~0).Y(x!1) -> X(y,p~1) + Y(x)   kcat
   
   X(p~1) -> X(p~0)                       dephos

end reaction rules

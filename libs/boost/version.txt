Selected headers from Boost version 1.71.0

This originally started as a small set of headers, however nfsim's requirements made this grow a lot.
Probably make a separate repo and move all hereaders there.
We would like to be independent on the system installation, beceuse not everyone has the permissions and 
getting the required version on some OSes might be tricky.
